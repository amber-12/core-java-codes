Q.5 What is static ? why it is used?
     - static keyword used in java with member function and member variable of class so you 
	can call it without using object.
     -Whenever we want to make any function or variable independant of class.
     -we can not use non static member inside static function.
     -whenever we want to set global value for any object which is not dependent upon any instance
      of class.
     -static variable is used to retain memory between every object it does not create seprate 
	space in in each object.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q.6 what is access specifier?
     -Access specifier are keyword in object oriented language that set accessibility of class
	method and other method.
     - there are 4 access specifiers.
     1)default
	    :- variable or method declare without any access contril modifier is avaiable to
		any other class.
     2)public 
	    :- can acessed from any other class.
     3)private
	    :- it can accessiable to only that class.
     4)protected
	    :- can be accessiable only by subclass in package.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q.7 what is array?
    - Collection of similler data element that belongs to same data type.it is an continious
	memory block which is used to store fixed amount of data.
    - it is used to optimise the performance of data usage inside the application.
    - we can access data randomly from any location.
    - we require array when there is multiple variable of same data type then that time we require
      array.
	we can declare array 
	data_type variable_name = new data_type[size];
    - array contain fixed size element. 
    - array indexing start from 0 to n.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q.8 what is wrapper class and why it is require?
     -it is an machanism to convert primitives into object and object into primitives.
      it is also callled as boxing and unboxing.
     -All Wrapper class is immutable.
     - We require wrapper class when we want to represent primitive in form of object so that
       we handle primitives just like object.
	Data_type	                 Wrapper class
___________________________________________________________
	byte                             Byte
	short				 Short
	int                              Integer
	long                             Long

Q.9 What is Algorithm?
    - Algorithm is step by step procidure for solving problems based on sequence specified by action.
    - It is step by step procidure to accomplish task.
    -Algorithm first step should be START.and last step should be STOP.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q.9 What is flow chart?
    -Flow chart is graphical representation of process each step in process is represented by different symbol
     and contains short discription of process step.	
    -Flow chart symbols are linked together with arrow showing the process flow direction.
    - it uses simple geomatric symbols and arrow to define relationship.
    -there are different geomatric symbol such as
     1)oval-for begin/end.
     2)rectangle- assignment statement.
     3)parallelogram- I/O data symbol.
     4)rhymbos- Decision making symbol.
     5)arrow- relationship.
_________

Q.10 What is condition and looping and how they help in applaying logic?
     -decision making is used specify the order in which statement are executed
     -Ability to control flow of program letting it make decision on what code to execute.
     -there are differnt conditional statement
        if,if else,nested if else.
     -loop means repetative task of execution it means that it repeat statement while given condition is true.
       there different looping statements.
         while loop,do-while loop,for loop.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q.11  What is operator?why it is required?

	- Operator is special symbol that tells compiler to do certain operation like
	   manupulation mathematical and logical.

	- Operator is used in program to manipulate data and variables.

	- if we want to do addition of two numbers then we required "+" operator.without 
	  using addition(+) operator we can not get addition of two numbers.

	- there are different types of operator in java
	
	1.arithmatical operator.
	2.Logical operator.
	3.relational operator.
	4.assingment.
	5.relational assignment.

Q.12 what is looping construct ? why it is req?

	-Loop is sequence of instruction that is countinually repeated until condition
	 becomes false.
	
	-Loop statement allows us to execute statement or group of statement multiple times.
	
	-we require looping bacause you may encounter situation when block of statement execute 
	 several times.

	-eg.
		if we want print to 1 to 100 numbers so it is very easy to print using loop
		 you take condition in any loop condtion like that i=1 while(i<=100) then 
		print i variable using output finction then increament i. it repeat statement 
		till condition becomes false.
	
	- Loop play vital role in programing.it makes programm shorter and simplier.

Q.13 what are different phases of looping?
	
	-  There are three phases of looping
	1.while loop.
	2.Do while loop.
	3.for loop.
	
	1.while loop- In while loop first it check the condition if condition is true
	   		then it execute statement.
	
	2.Do while loop- in this first it execute statement then it check body of loop.

	3.for loop- In for loop is different from both above mentioned in for first it 
			initialize then check condition then execute statement then variable
		    increamented or decreamented.
  


Q.14  what is differance bitween while,Do_while and for loop?

	-While loop
		:-while loop is an entry control loop.in while loop first  it check condition if
		  condition is true then it will execute body of loop.again it will check condition
		  if condition is true then it will execute body this process till continue when 
		  condition becomes false.if condition becomes false then it does not execute body.
		 -we use while loop when we dont know what exact time to execute body of loop.
		Syntax
                     :-
			while(condition)
		 	{
				statement;
			       increament/decreament;
			}
	-Do while
		:-it is an exit control loop.it does not check the condition directly execute 
		  statement then at last it check condition.
		  In do while loop statement execute or body of loop will execute atlist once.
		  It doesn matter condtion false or true it will execute body of loop atlist
		  once.
		 Syntax
		     :-
			Do
			{
			 Statement;
			inreament/decreament.
			}while(condition);
	
	-for loop
		:-for loop is an entry control loop first it check condition if condition is true 
		   then only execute body of loop.this process still continue upto condition becomes
		  false.
		 Syntax
			:- 
			for(initilisation;condition;increament/decreament)
				{
				Statement;
				}

Q.15 what is constructor?
    -it is used to initialize member variable in class.
    - every time you create a instance of class it has to be initialize to support its usage and to 
      initialize the instance of class.
    -any class which is created by default support constructor weather it is created inside the program
     or not.
     properties.
    - it is special function.
    - because name of constructor same as class name.
    -this is function has no return type.
    -it should be always public.
    - there are two types of constructor parameterised and default.
    - As per rule base class constructor get executed first.if we do not call any base class constructor
      in child class.
	  declaration
     access specifier class_name();
________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q.16 what is function overriding?
    - Whenever we use base class function inside child class to implement same functionality with
      different value is called as function overriding.
    - In function overriding function name are same but definamtions of both function different.
    - any mathod declare with final and static keyword can not be override.
________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q.17 what is function overloading?
    - method declare multiple times with same name and different parameter is called as overloading.
    - we can differentiat method by parameters that is (NTS)
      number of parameter,types of parameter,sequence of parameter
________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q.18 what is inheritance?
    - deriving class from existing class is called as inheritance.we can inherit all properties of
      parent class into child class.
    - Inheritance helps programmer in generalization and specialization.general properties are 
      part of base class and special properties are part of child class.
    - we can inherit one class from another by extend keyword.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q.19 what is interface?
    -interface is collection of abstract class.interface used to support abstraction as wll as
      multiple inheritance.
    -interface contain method without body and body of method can written inside class.
    -Interface contain only static and final variable.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q.20 what is return type of function?
    -return type is the function may return a value.the return type is the data type of the value
     the function return there are different return type such as int,float,void,string,char etc.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Q.21 what is void?
    -In computer programming, when void is used as a function return type, it indicates that the function 
     does not return a value.
    -Void functions, also called nonvalue-returning functions, are used just like value-returning functions
     except void return types do not return a value when the function is executed.
